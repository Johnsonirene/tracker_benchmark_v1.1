## The tracker codes for ICCV2019 can be [download here](https://github.com/XU-TIANYANG/GFS-DCF). 
More group feature selection strategies are explored.

### The tracker codes for VOT2018 can be [download here](https://github.com/XU-TIANYANG/LADCF_VOT). 
More powerful features and data augmentation techniques are added for the VOT2018.

### Instruction for LADCF_HC Tracker:
Learning Adaptive Discriminative Correlation Filter on Low-dimensional Manifold (LADCF) utilises adaptive spatial regularizer to train low-dimensional discriminative correlation filters. We follow a single-frame learning and updating strategy: the filters are learned after tracking stage and then updated using a fixed rate [1]. We use HOG [2] and CN [3]. Code modules refer to ECO [4] in feature extraction.
